Installed and configured GDT, IDT, IRQs, ISRs and timer interrupt.
The code will print what we are typing on the screen and at the same time prints a message when the timer interrupt fires.

Work environment : Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 32 bit 
requirement : nasm assembler, qemu

to emulate:
make 
qemu -kernel kernel.bin

to run it from a bootable pendrive (not sure about this, I forgot)
make a bootable usb
http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-via-grub2-using-linux/
After making the usb bootable mount the usb and copy kernel.bin to the usb (to any folder)
Then boot from usb (you can use qemu also)
then root=(had0,0)
boot
