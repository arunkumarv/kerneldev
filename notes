Type fdisk /dev/sdx (replacing x with your actual usb device)
Type d (to delete the existing partition)
Type n (to create a new partition)
Type p (for primary partition)
Type 1 (to create the first partition)
Press Enter (to use the first cylinder)
Press Enter again (to use the default value as the last cylinder)
Type a (for active)
Type 1 (to mark the first partition active "bootable")
Type w (to write the changes and close fdisk)
II. Create a Fat32 Filesystem on the USB Flash Drive:

Type umount /dev/sdx1 (to unmount the mounted partition)
Type mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n MULTIBOOT /dev/sdx1 (to format the partition as fat32)
III. Install Grub2 on the USB Flash Drive:

Type mkdir /media/MULTIBOOT (to create a directory for the mountpoint)
Type mount /dev/sdx1 /media/MULTIBOOT (to mount the USB)
Type grub-install --force --no-floppy --root-directory=/media/MULTIBOOT /dev/sdx (to install Grub2)
Type cd /media/MULTIBOOT/boot/grub (to change directory)
Type wget pendrivelinux.com/downloads/multibootlinux/grub.cfg (to get the grub.cfg file)
